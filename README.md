> This little repo was made because I'm very lazy to always keep building a project from scratch... and also to learn a bit about bash script.

## :question: What is this about?

This repo is a collection of bash scripts created to automate the project base construction, so it is just to use and be happy :)

### :interrobang: How can you use it?

It's actually very simple, you just have to click the "Use this template" button up there :arrow_up:

[![Use this template](./_docs/use-this-template-btn.png)](https://github.com/SlyCooper-n/models/generate)

You can also go by CLI, of course

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SlyCooper-n/models.git

# or
gh repo clone SlyCooper-n/models
```

After you have this on your machine, do the following:

```bash
# this will run the sript to create a new project
bash models/ctnewpj.sh
```

## :inbox_tray: Arguments

```bash
bash ./ctnewpj.sh <repoName> # there will be more...
